## Functionality and features

Customers can either buy other customers products or sell their own.

## Design Process
 -> WHY P2P ?!? 
Generally, the ecommerce websites usually offer a ONE-WAY marketplace except a few. For normal users, everyday users, this platform would give them the ability to sell their own products on a peer to peer market without a mediator. 
As a customer he/she would be able to sell/buy from one account on P2Pstore. 
Steps for developing P2PStore : <br/>
1 Design wireframes for how the website would look like homepage/showpage/ user sign in/signup pages etc. ]<br/>
2 styling the website side by side. (unable to finish) <br/>
3 Start by using devise for authentication and registering users<br/>
4 generate models for products using the scaffolding method. <br/>
5 Using builtin active storage for rails 5.2 to add image uploading capability <br/>
6 Write methods for users to create/edit/delete their own products. <br/>
7 Write methods for cart control. <br/>
8 adding stripe for payment option. <br/>
9 Updating repo on git<br/>
10 once finished, deploying site on heroku<br/>
